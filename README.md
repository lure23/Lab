# Labs.cfp-sk-gcip

A testing ground for [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). 


![](.images/tools-triad.png)

Web development can be seen as a triangle of tools and services.

- Framework defines the application (both web client and back end). We use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).
- Deployment takes care of keeping the application available, and scaling up/down to keep costs at bay. We choose [Cloudflare Pages](https://www.cloudflare.com).
- Identity management helps authenticate our users, to manage them, and to grant them rights. Our initial choice here is [Google Cloud Identity Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/identity-platform)



## Pre-reading

### Cloudflare

- [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) (Cloudflare docs)

	These are important! It's a lot of reading, but we expect you to know this stuff.
	
- ["Blazing fast development with full-stack frameworks and Cloudflare"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/blazing-fast-development-with-full-stack-frameworks-and-cloudflare) (blog; Apr'24)

	Since April 2024, the approach of server-side functions with regard to Cloudflare Pages has changed: they are now rolled out in the "most natural way possible" for any supported web framework.
	
	This is GREAT NEWS!  It means you can develop *as normal* with SvelteKit, including `npm run dev` - but get locally simulated backend services in the purchase!
	
>The new approach means that **`functions/`** folder is now ignored. You don't define back-end features through there. Some (quite a few!) places in the Cloudflare Pages still don't reflect this, and the reading / learning path may be confusing! Obviously, the docs will eventually pick up, but at the moment, this is how it is. As a whole, the transition is a very nice move that helps make development way simpler.

### SvelteKit

Also [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) knowledge is expected. You can probably "wing it" (i.e. understand by reading) if you have experience from other full stack frameworks. Just that this repo is not about teaching SvelteKit.

### Google Cloud Identity Platform

This one is a bit of a bipedal creation. You can do *all* access using [Google Cloud Identity Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/identity-platform) console - but the best documentation is on the side of [Firebase Admin Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin).

In short, these are the same product. We need just a fraction of the abilities, and anything you need to set up is described below.

>Obviously, other identity providers exist as well. Just happens so that the author was already familiar with Google and cough-Firebase-/cough.


## Requirements

- A Cloudflare account
- A Google Cloud account
- a [`web-cf`](https://github.com/akauppi/mp/tree/main/web%2Bcf) VM

	You can also run the instructions at your host, at your own risk. Why... would you do that? :)
	
	- this folder mounted as `~/Lab.cfp-sk-gcip`

	>Note: Using Multipass introduces some hurdles, with regard to file mapping and port forwarding. These are covered in the docs below.

<!--developed on:

- macOS 14.5
- Multipass 1.14.0-rc1
-->


## Prepare

<!-- DEV NOTE: When doing these steps, make sure `wrangler` is not logged in: `$ wrangler logout; wrangler whoami`
-->

Commands below happen in the VM, unless otherwise stated.

```
$ cd Lab.cfp-sk-gcip/def
```

We don't need a connection to Cloudflare. Check that you are not logged in:

```
$ wrangler logout

 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.62.0
-------------------

Not logged in, exiting...
```

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Below, we are going to discuss:

- Local development (`npm run dev`)
- Local preview (`npm run preview`)
- Deployment (`npm run deploy`)


## Local development

```
$ npm run dev

> def@0.0.1 dev
> vite dev


  VITE v5.3.1  ready in 17244 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.64.105:5173/
  ‚ûú  press h + enter to show help
```

- Open the said `http://192.168.64.105:5173` URL. Do you see a web page?

	>Hint: On macOS Terminal, you can Cmd-double-clicking on such a URL. Opens in default browser.
	
	The direct VM IP works as such, but if you want also the `localhost` URL
	to be usable, you'll need to forward it from the VM to your host. The `mp` repo has a helper for this.
	
	```
	$ PORT=5173 {path-to-mp}/tools/port-fwd.sh
	```

	Unfortunately, Multipass doesn't support native port forwards.

>![](.images/welcome.png)

### Hot module reload

Now, edit `def/src/routes/+page.svelte` in an IDE. Save the change.

Did you see the change?

Hot module reload means that you should not need to refresh the browser. Changes will be reflected automatically.

>![](.images/wwwelcome.png)

### Server-side functions

Keep the service running. Open [`http://192.168.64.105:5173/abc`](http://192.168.64.105:5173/abc).

>This should show ![](.images/abc_hello.png), defined in `src/routes/abc/+server.js`.

Edit the said file, changing the text. 

Now you need to refresh the browser, since the text is not static web content but created anew for each request. Do you see the change?

### Authentication

Let's bring in authentication to the mix. 

For this, you'll need to [go through some hoops](...) to set up a project in the Google Cloud Console.

---
*a few minutes later.. üåòüêå*

---

Back? Great!

You now have an `API Key` and `AuthDomain` that can be fed to the `firebase-admin` library.

### Something D1

#### Necessary preparation

Before we can use D1 (Cloudflare SQL database), we need to move the `.wrangler/state` path away from the mounted folder. D1 simulation wouldn't work on a mounted network folder.

>Also, wrangler 3 doesn't seem to have a setting so that we could point it to a safe partition, declaratively.


- Stop the `npm run dev` (ctrl-c)

   ```
   $ install -d ~/.def.wrangler.state
   $ rmdir .wrangler/state
   $ (cd .wrangler && ln -s ~/.def.wrangler.state state)
   ```

---

- Create a database by:

   ```
   $ wrangler d1 execute lab-db --local --file d1/schema.sql
	```

	If that doesn't give an error, you can proceed.

<!_-- Output:

- Start again `npm run dev`

What's different?

This is no longer hot-module-reloaded. If you re-change the `+page.svelte`, it won't change in `http://localhost:8788`. In fact, even if you *refresh*, it still doesn't change.

The web app is now built for production, but still running locally.

A preview allows you to interactively check that building didn't break anything. <!-- #later See automated tests below, for how to also prove that things didn't break. -->

<!-- tbd. UI should show dev/preview/[] -->

		

## Deployment

Deploying with Cloudflare Pages is simple. Just tie your GitHub account with the service, create a new Pages deployment.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Root directory: `def`

In addition, ESLint 9 [requires Node.js >= 18.18.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/#node.js-%3C-v18.18.0%2C-v19-no-longer-supported) so:

- `Settings` > `Environment variables`

      >![](.images/cf-node-version.png)
      
   - and same for `Preview`

Now, your pages get deployed to an URL like `https://lab-4hl.pages.dev` at each new push to `main` (where the build succeeds).


<!-- tbd. 
## Testing
-->

## Some background (optional)

The `def` folder has originally been created by:

```
$ npm create cloudflare@latest def -- --framework=svelte
```

>Note: Cloudflare uses `svelte` and SvelteKit interchangeably. The above means SvelteKit (the full stack framework), not only Svelte (the browser-side framework).

The creation ends with:

```
[...]
‚îÇ Navigate to the new directory cd def
‚îÇ Run the development server **npm run dev**
‚îÇ Preview your application **npm run preview**
‚îÇ Deploy your application **npm run deploy**
‚îÇ Read the documentation https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages
‚îÇ Stuck? Join us at https://discord.cloudflare.com
```

The suggested commands are the normal SvelteKit development commands. The way Cloudflare integrates with this framework (since Apr'24) is admirable! üëèüëè
