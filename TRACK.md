- [ ] Ability to define `.wrangler/state` path, within `wrangler.toml`

	We have the special case of a mounted network folder, and D1 simulation
	doesn't like to work in one. That's undestandable.
	
	Being able to use something outside of the work folder would fix this for us, in a way that doesn't involve setting up symbolic links.
