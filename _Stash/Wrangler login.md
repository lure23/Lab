# Wrangler login

In the main `README`, we noticed you can do all deployments without ever tying the `wrangler` CLI to a Cloudflare account. This is great.

However, there may be times when you need/want to handle your project from the CLI. Here's how:

## Required

- Cloudflare account
- `web-cf` VM set up in Multipass


## `wrangler login` in a VM

Pass the port 8976 from VM to the host (so your browser will find it).
 
```
$ {path-to-mp}/web+cf/login-fwd.sh 
*
* Going to forward the port '192.168.64.105:8976' as 'localhost:8976' so the dance can begin.
*
* This will require a 'sudo' pw next.
*
Press a key to continue...
Password:
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.64.105' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
*
* Port is now forwarded.
* Please
*   - run 'wrangler login --browser=false' in the VM
*   - open the provided link in a browser you use with Cloudflare
*   - sign in
*
* Once the CLI is happy (you may try 'wrangler whoami'), press a key and we'll close the port forward.
*
Press a key once login dance is over...
```

Within the VM:

```
$ wrangler login --browser=false

 ⛅️ wrangler 3.60.2
-------------------

Attempting to login via OAuth...
Visit this link to authenticate: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=54d11594-...
```

- Open the link in the browser you use for Cloudflare access.

- In the browser:

   - Read and press `Allow`:

   >![](.images/cf-login.png)
   
   <p />
   
   >![](.images/wrangler-welcome.png)

`wrangler` CLI is now connected to the cloud.

Press a key on the host, to close the port forward.


### Hints

- If the `wrangler login` times out (it doesn't give that many minutes to decide on `Allow`), just try again!

- Check your identity (and logged-in state) with:

	```
	$ wrangler whoami

	 ⛅️ wrangler 3.61.0
